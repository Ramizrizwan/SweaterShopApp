# SweaterShopApp

## 💡 Inspiration
* ☀️Created an app for my friend to sell her sweaters. 

* :nerd_face:	Interested in deepening my skills and understanding of IOS development.
* :technologist:	Wanting experience with integrating payment in my work, gained experience in implementing Apple Pay
Created a sweater shopping app integrating apple pay
Here is the main screen of the app.

## 🌱 What it does
* 🛒 Allows Customers to view and select sweaters, add to their shopping cart, and purchase their selections. 
* :credit_card:	Payment is though Apple Pay.
* :email:	Once the customers finishes payment, a confirmation page will be prompted. 
* The owner will be sent an email regarding the transactions.
